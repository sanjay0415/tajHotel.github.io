->create a database "hotelproject", create table inside that as "admin_cred"
->create row as "sr_no", "admin_name", "admin_pass"
->create "db_config.php" file inside "inc" inside "admin" folder, where inside this file we do about connecting to the database
->we are writing "required" inside input tag which means data must be given cumpolsarily
->in "form" tag data is send in "POST" method as we are sending sensitive data
->creating backend for above Admin login Panel form
->"isset" - function returns true if the variable exists and is not NULL, otherwise it returns false
->creating function fitration in "db_config.php" (this function is done bcoz when data is sent in POST method it is sent in form of arrays which contains whitespace, commas, colon, etc  to remove this we use function in filtration function)

->"mysqli_prepare" - Prepares an SQL statement for execution, "mysqli_stmt_bind_param" - Binds variables to a prepared statement as parameters, "mysqli_stmt_execute" - Executes a prepared statement.

->create a file "essential.php" for storing small functions, inside this create "redirect" function, where when you give url it directs you to that url

->create "dashboard.php" page and edit as needed
->create "logout.php" page, when this option is clicked in dashboard.php page we end the Sessions and redirect to index.php page
